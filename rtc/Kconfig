        help
            I2C address of the MCP7940 RTC. Default is 0x6F.

    config I2C_PORT_NUM
        int "I2C Port Number"
        range 0 1
        default 0
        help
            I2C port number to use for RTC communication. Default is 0.

        bool "Automatically sync system time from RTC on boot"
        default y
        help
            If enabled, the system time will be synchronized from the RTC
            during initialization. This is useful to maintain time across
            reboots when network is not available.

    config RTC_AUTO_SYNC_FROM_NTP
        bool "Automatically sync RTC from system time after NTP sync"
        default y
        help
            If enabled, the RTC will be synchronized from the system time
            whenever NTP synchronization completes successfully. This keeps
            the RTC accurate when network is available.

    config RTC_ENABLE_BATTERY_BACKUP
        bool "Enable battery backup by default"
        default y
        help
            If enabled, battery backup will be enabled during initialization.
            This allows the RTC to maintain time when main power is lost.
